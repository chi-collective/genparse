For example, the CSS language definition\\n       * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\\n       * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\\n       * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\\n       * this:\\n       *\\n       * ```js\\n       * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\\n       *     // token\\n       * };\\n       * ```\\n       *\\n       * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\\n       * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\\n       *\\n       * ```js\\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore(\\'markup\\', \\'cdata\\', {\\n       *     \\'style\\': {\\n       *         // token\\n       *     }\\n       * });\\n       * ```\\n       *\\n       * ## Special cases\\n       *\\n       * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`\\'s grammar\\n       * will be ignored.\\n       *\\n       * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\\n       *\\n       * ```js\\n       * Prism.languages.insertBefore(\\'markup\\', \\'comment\\', {\\n       *     \\'comment\\': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\\n       *     // tokens after \\'comment\\'\\n       * });\\n       * ```\\n       *\\n       * ## Limitations\\n       *\\n       * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\\n       * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\\n       * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can\\'t be implemented by temporarily\\n       * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\\n       *\\n       * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn\\'t actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\\n       * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\\n       * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\\n       *\\n       * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\\n       * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\\n       *\\n       * ```js\\n       * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\\n       * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore(\\'markup\\', \\'comment\\', { ... });\\n       *\\n       * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\\n       * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\\n       * ```\\n       *\\n       * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\\n       * object to be modified.\\n       * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\\n       * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\\n       * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\\n       * object to be modified.\\n       *\\n       * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\\n       * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\\n       * @public\\n       */\\n      insertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\\n        root = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\\n        var grammar = root[inside];\\n        /** @type {Grammar} */\\n        var ret = {};\\n\\n        for (var token in grammar) {\\n          if (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\\n            if (token == before) {\\n              for (var newToken in insert) {\\n                if (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\\n                  ret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\\n                }\\n              }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Do not insert token which also occur in insert.
