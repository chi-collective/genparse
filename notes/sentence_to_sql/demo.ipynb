    "Some judgment calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to get all the possible matches, rather than the likely intended referent of a name. That is: Refrain from inferring (with certainty) that Dirac means *Paul* Dirac the mathematician, or that Mr. Lee necessarily means *Lee Kuan* Yew the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Likewise, refrain from inferring we necessarily want *Mohandas* (or titular Mahatma) Gandhi, *Neville* Chamberlain, Eleanor *Roosevelt*, *Katalin* Kariko (if its training data is recent enough), *Kelly* Clarkson, *Augusta Ada King, Countess of* Lovelace, and *Charles* Babbage. If the full name isn't specified, we won't try to guess it.\n",
    "2. Returning extra results (e.g. querying for Truman and Churchill in addition to Eleanor Roosevelt) is fine as long as we the query ORs them with the important conditions, rather than ANDing them.\n",
    "3. Strengthening the conditions with AND terms is bad.\n",
    "4. Ordering and grouping don't matter.\n",
    "5. The names are stored in the database as ASCII. So, Kariko rather than Karikó.\n",
    "6. We don't attempt to filter on anything except the names. In theory, we could try to filter on the occupation here, but it might be coded as 'writer' or more narrowly as 'songwriter' or as 'singer'... or any number of other things. I'm sure Wikidata has lots of possible occupation Qnodes and any given entry might or might not link against all the relevant ones, so this just seems like a chance to shoot ourselves in the foot and exclude valid matches.\n",
    "7. When a sentence names multiple people, we query for all named people at once, rather than writing separate queries for each person.\n",
    "8. We DO want to allow the inference that Bristol is not the name of a person.\n",
    "9. Names have a bunch of weird edge cases that we are going to ignore for now. *Ada Lovelace* is just one example: Her first name wasn't Ada (it was Augusta) and her family name wasn't Lovelace (it was King). A related challenge is the ordering of given name vs. family name -- is it the conventional Western ordering (given THEN family) or something else?"

Sometimes it generates even dumber conditions, like `\"date_of_birthLabel.value\" = '1923'` --- obviously he wasn't born in 1923, babies don't get awarded first-class honors in university (implied to be graduate-level) mathematics, it's just a year that happens to be zmentioned in the sentence.\n",
